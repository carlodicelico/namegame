NameGame
========

A simple NodeJS script that generates startup names and checks to see if the corresponding domain name is available.

Requirements
------------

NameGame requires node 0.8.x and the colors, fs, http, commander, and sugar node modules.

Usage
-----

To use NameGame from the command-line, update namegame.js to use your DNS API provider and API key and do `node namegame.js`.

To use the web interface, just open namegame.html in your browser. Please note that domain-name checking is only supported in the command-line.
